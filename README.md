# MCEdit-Unified-Linux-Preview

This repository hosts Linux development releases of __[MCEdit-Unified](https://github.com/Podshot/MCEdit-Unified-Preview)__.

You'll also find there the `.so` files for Pocket Edition support.
These files are also embedded in the installer.

You'll also find here the installer documentation.

This repository, and the releases here, are made like [Podshot's one](https://github.com/Podshot/MCEdit-Unified-Preview).
Please have also a look there. The same ideas apply here :smile:  
However, the Linux builds are not triggered on a regular basis.


## IMPORTANT

* Be very careful with these builds; they are development builds and may not behave as expected!
  * Backup you data, especially the one related to the game and this program.  
    MCEdit-Unified configuration files are located in `~/.mcedit` if you're running 'fixed'.
* These testing releases are roughly tested and may not work at all.
  * If the installer do not work, or MCEdit do not start, please report **here**.
  * All other issues shall be reported to [the source code repository](https://github.com/Podshot/MCEdit-Unified/issues).
* [RTFD](https://github.com/LaChal/MCEdit-Unified-Linux-Preview/doc).

Note that I'm not responsible in case of data loss or corruption!

## WHAT IS THIS FUZZY NUMBER AT THE END OF THE VERSION?

This is sort of identifier.
Precisely, it is the number of seconds since `epoch`.
